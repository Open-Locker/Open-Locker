# Coding Style Deltas (Beyond Boost)

Boost already enforces broad coding practices. This rule keeps only
project-specific quality requirements.

- Use `declare(strict_types=1);` in PHP files unless the file follows an
  established legacy pattern that omits it.
- Run static checks after meaningful backend changes:
  - `sail artisan pint`
  - `sail artisan stan`
