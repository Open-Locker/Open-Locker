# Laravel Backend Deltas (Beyond Boost)

Use this rule only for Open-Locker-specific Laravel conventions that are not
already covered by Boost guidelines.

## Architecture

- This backend is API-first; no public Blade UI.
- The only server-rendered UI is Filament for administrative workflows.

## Application Patterns

- Prefer the Service Pattern over Action classes for business logic.
- Keep controllers thin and delegate orchestration to services.
- Use `JsonResource` for API payloads unless an endpoint already follows a
  different established contract.
