# Mobile i18n Standards

- Never hardcode new user-facing UI text in components or screens.
- Always use translation keys via `t(...)` from `react-i18next`.
- Add every new key to both locales in `src/i18n/resources.ts`:
  - `en` is the default/fallback language.
  - `de` must be kept in sync.
- Group keys by feature domain (for example `auth.*`, `account.*`,
  `compartments.*`, `common.*`) instead of flat key names.
- Prefer interpolation for dynamic values (for example status codes,
  versions, names) instead of string concatenation.
- Keep API payload/content values untranslated unless they are rendered as
  UI labels.
- When adding a new screen, add its navigation/header strings to i18n as
  well.
