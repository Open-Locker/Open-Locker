# Mobile Code Quality Tools

Use these tools consistently for all changes in `mobile-app/`:

- ESLint with Expo Flat config (`eslint-config-expo`)
- Prettier for formatting
- TypeScript type checks (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Expo Doctor for SDK/dependency health checks

## Required scripts

- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run format:check`
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run check`

## Workflow

1. During development, use `pnpm run format` when needed.
2. Before opening a PR, run `pnpm run check`.
3. For API regeneration, use `pnpm run quality:api` after backend spec updates.

## Notes

- Do not manually edit generated API files such as `src/store/generatedApi.ts`.
- Keep formatting and linting clean; avoid committing code that fails checks.
