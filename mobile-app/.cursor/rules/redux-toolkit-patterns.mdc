# Redux Toolkit Patterns

- Prefer feature slices over action/reducer split files.
- Keep selectors near the slice that owns the state shape.
- Put as much state transition logic as possible in reducers.
- Keep store setup in `src/store/store.ts`; keep app-wide API base setup isolated.

## Suggested store layout

```text
src/
  store/
    store.ts
    baseApi.ts
  features/
    auth/
      authSlice.ts
      selectors.ts
```

## API and side effects

- Keep RTK Query setup centralized; inject endpoints per feature if needed.
- Avoid importing the store directly in random modules; use thunks/middleware/injection patterns.
