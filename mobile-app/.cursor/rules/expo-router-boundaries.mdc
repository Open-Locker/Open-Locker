# Expo Router Boundaries

- Keep `app/` for routes and `_layout` files only.
- Do not place reusable UI, hooks, or services in `app/`.
- Put reusable code in `src/` (for example `src/features`, `src/components`, `src/lib`).
- For complex screens, keep route files thin and render screen modules from `src/screens` or `src/features/*/screens`.

## Route wrapper pattern

```tsx
import { HomeScreen } from "@/src/screens/home";

export default function IndexRoute() {
  return <HomeScreen />;
}
```

## Notes

- Keep route-level concerns in routes (params, redirects, guards).
- Keep business logic and UI composition in feature or screen modules.
