# Mobile Testing Patterns

- Prefer colocated tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` next to source files.
- Test behavior and contracts, not implementation details.
- Prioritize tests for feature hooks, state selectors/reducers, and utility logic.
- Use `jest-expo` preset for Expo-compatible unit tests.
- Use `@testing-library/react-native` for component tests.

## Suggested priorities

1. Business logic in feature model and reducers.
2. Data mapping and transformation utilities.
3. Critical user flows in screen-level modules.

## Practical rules

- Keep tests deterministic; isolate network with mocks.
- For bug fixes, add or update a test that reproduces the issue.
- Avoid `react-test-renderer` for new tests in React 19+ projects.
