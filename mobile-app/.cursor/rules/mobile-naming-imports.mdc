# Naming and Imports

- Use `kebab-case` for file names by default.
- Keep React component names in `PascalCase`.
- Use stable aliases for imports and keep relative deep paths minimal.
- Avoid barrel files that hide too much; use them for explicit feature public APIs only.

## Platform files (Android and iOS)

- Use `.android` and `.ios` suffixes only when behavior differs significantly.
- Keep shared fallback in a base file (for example `button.tsx` plus `button.ios.tsx`).
- Keep exported props identical across platform variants.

## Consistency

- Match naming and folder conventions across all new features.
- Prefer small, explicit modules over generic catch-all files.
- Import and use existing shared components instead of creating near-duplicate components with different names.
- Only create a new component when responsibilities or props differ meaningfully from existing shared components.
