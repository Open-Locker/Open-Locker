# Mobile Feature Architecture

- Use a hybrid structure: file-based routing in `app/`, domain logic in `src/features/*`.
- Organize by feature first, then by technical concern inside each feature.
- Keep shared primitives in `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, and `src/types`.

## Recommended shape

```text
src/
  features/
    auth/
      api/
      hooks/
      ui/
      model/
      index.ts
```

## Rules of thumb

- Prefer feature-local files over global folders when code is not reused.
- Promote code to shared folders only after real reuse appears.
- Keep feature public API explicit with a small `index.ts`.
