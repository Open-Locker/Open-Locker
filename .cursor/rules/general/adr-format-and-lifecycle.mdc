# ADR Format and Lifecycle

Store ADRs in `docs/adr/` and use numeric, kebab-case file names:

- `0001-short-title.md`
- `0002-next-decision.md`

## ADR Structure

Use this section order:

1. Title
2. Status
3. Date
4. Context
5. Decision
6. Alternatives Considered
7. Consequences
8. References

## Lifecycle Rules

- Keep one architecture decision per ADR.
- Do not rewrite accepted ADR history.
- When direction changes, create a new ADR and mark the old one superseded.
- Link old and new ADRs for traceability.

## Traceability Rules

When implementation follows an ADR, reference the ADR in:

- commit message or PR description
- implementation notes
- related technical documentation
