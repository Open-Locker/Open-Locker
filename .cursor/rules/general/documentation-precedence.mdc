description: Clarify ADR precedence over no-doc defaults

# Documentation Rule Precedence

Use this precedence when multiple rules apply:

1. ADR requirements for architecture-significant changes take priority.
2. General "do not create docs unless asked" guidance applies only when no
   ADR-triggering condition is met.

If an ADR trigger is present, create or update ADRs in `docs/adr/` even when
no explicit documentation request was made.
