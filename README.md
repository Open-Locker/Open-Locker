```sh
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

## Docker

This project is set up for a **static** Astro build served by **NGINX**.

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t open-locker-webpage .
```

Run it locally:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 open-locker-webpage
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## GitLab CI/CD

The pipeline in `.gitlab-ci.yml` builds a Docker image and pushes it to the **GitLab Container Registry**:

- **`$CI_COMMIT_SHA`** tag for immutable builds
- **`$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG`** tag for branch builds
- **`latest`** is published on `main`

### Coolify deployment (recommended with Docker Image)

If you run your own **Coolify** instance, you can deploy the pushed image via a Coolify **Docker Image** resource.

1. In Coolify, create a resource of type **Docker Image** and point it to your GitLab registry image, e.g.:
   - `registry.gitlab.com/<group>/<project>:latest`
2. If your registry is private, create a GitLab **Deploy Token** with `read_registry` and configure Coolify to be able to pull the image (Coolify docs describe the required `docker login` on the server).
3. In the Coolify resource, go to **Webhooks** and copy the **Deploy Webhook** URL.
4. Create a Coolify **API token** with deploy permissions.
5. In GitLab, add CI/CD variables:
   - `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK`: the Deploy Webhook URL from Coolify
   - `COOLIFY_TOKEN`: the Coolify API token (mask + protect recommended)

Now every successful `main` pipeline triggers a redeploy in Coolify.
